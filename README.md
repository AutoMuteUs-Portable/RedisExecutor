# ExecutorController
This is a template implementation of ExecutorController for [AutoMuteUs Portable](https://github.com/mtaku3/AutoMuteUs-Portable)
This will be built as .dll and dynamically loaded into AutoMuteUs Portable

# How to use this template
1. Create new repository using this template
2. Initialize submodule by hitting `git submodule update --init`
3. Update submodule by hitting `git submodule update –-remote`

We always try to make the submodule up-to-date in this repository but it may not be. Make sure to update submodule by hitting the above command.
